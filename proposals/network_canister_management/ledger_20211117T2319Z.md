## Summary

Updating Ledger to Wasm module with hash `61a312e4bf4f86899edabf6b3cedc504b2b0825d9b7956abea65582095692a9a` built from git commit `88d24e7def3b6ef41508d753f4037dd76d940a6d`.

## Rationale

This update contains changes required to allow all canisters to transfer ICP by sending messages to the Ledger canister:

  * The ledger doesn't apply the whitelist when it decides whether to allow the transfer to the caller.
    All principals except for the anonymous are allowed to transfer ICP now.

  * The ledger exposes 2 new Candid endpoints: `account_balance` and `transfer` (see the full Candid interface below).
    More Candid endpoints (e.g., an endpoint for fetching blocks) shall be added in subsequent proposals.

The newly exposed candid interface:

```candid
// Amount of ICP tokens, measured in 10^-8 of a token.
type ICP = record {
     e8s : nat64;
};

// Number of nanoseconds from the UNIX epoch in UTC timezone.
type Timestamp = record {
    timestamp_nanos: nat64;
};

// AccountIdentifier is a 32-byte array.
// The first 4 bytes is big-endian encoding of a CRC32 checksum of the last 28 bytes.
type AccountIdentifier = blob;

// Subaccount is an arbitrary 32-byte byte array.
// Ledger uses subaccounts to compute the source address, which enables one
// principal to control multiple ledger accounts.
type SubAccount = blob;

// Sequence number of a block produced by the ledger.
type BlockIndex = nat64;

// An arbitrary number associated with a transaction.
// The caller can set it in a `transfer` call as a correlation identifier.
type Memo = nat64;

// Arguments for the `transfer` call.
type TransferArgs = record {
    // Transaction memo.
    // See comments for the `Memo` type.
    memo: Memo;
    // The amount that the caller wants to transfer to the destination address.
    amount: ICP;
    // The amount that the caller pays for the transaction.
    // Must be 10000 e8s.
    fee: ICP;
    // The subaccount from which the caller wants to transfer funds.
    // If null, the ledger uses the default (all zeros) subaccount to compute the source address.
    // See comments for the `SubAccount` type.
    from_subaccount: opt SubAccount;
    // The destination account.
    // If the transfer is successful, the balance of this address increases by `amount`.
    to: AccountIdentifier;
    // The point in time when the caller created this request.
    // If null, the ledger uses current IC time as the timestamp.
    created_at_time: opt Timestamp;
};

type TransferError = variant {
    // The fee that the caller specified in the transfer request was not the one that ledger expects.
    // The caller can change the transfer fee to the `expected_fee` and retry the request.
    BadFee : record { expected_fee : ICP; };
    // The account specified by the caller doesn't have enough funds.
    InsufficientFunds : record { balance: ICP; };
    // The request is too old.
    // The ledger only accepts requests created within 24 hours window.
    // This is a non-recoverable error.
    TxTooOld : record { allowed_window_nanos: nat64 };
    // The caller specified `created_at_time` that is too far in future.
    // The caller can retry the request later.
    TxCreatedInFuture : null;
    // The ledger has already executed the request.
    // `duplicate_of` field is equal to the index of the block containing the original transaction.
    TxDuplicate : record { duplicate_of: BlockIndex; }
};

type TransferResult = variant {
    Ok : BlockIndex;
    Err : TransferError;
};

// Arguments for the `account_balance` call.
type AccountBalanceArgs = record {
    account: AccountIdentifier;
};

service : {
  // Transfers tokens from a subaccount of the caller to the destination address.
  // The source address is computed from the principal of the caller and the specified subaccount.
  // When successful, returns the index of the block containing the transaction.
  transfer : (TransferArgs) -> (TransferResult);

  // Returns the amount of ICP on the specified account.
  account_balance : (AccountBalanceArgs) -> (ICP) query;
}
```
